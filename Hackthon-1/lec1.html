       <h3>Q. What is Internet?</h3>
       <p>- The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that allows users to access and share information and devices, allowing them to communicate and exchange data. It enables users to access a wide range of services, such as websites, emails, social media, online applications, and cloud storage. Through standardized communication protocols, the Internet facilitates the sharing of information, resources, and media across vast distances, making it an essential tool for worldwide:</p>

       <h3>Q. How Does Internet Work?</h3>
       <p><b>The Need to Share information:-</b></p>
       <p>- The most fundamental truth is that we have information on one computer (Computer A) and we want it to be on another computer (Computer B). These computers are not in the same room.<br>How do we solve this? The simplest, most primitive way is to physically carry the information (e.g., on a USB stick). This works, but it's slow and doesn't scale. We need a direct, electronic connection.<br>So, we run a cable (like an ethernet cable or a fiber optic line) between Computer A and Computer B. We can now send electrical signals or pulses of light down this cable. We can agree on a simple code: a high-voltage signal means "1," and a low-voltage signal means "0."<br>We have just created the most basic form of a network: a direct link. We can now send bits (1s and 0s) between two computers.</p>

       <h3>The Problem of Scale.</h3>
       <p>- This works for two computers. But what if we have three computers (A, B, and C) and they all need to talk to each other? We would need a cable from A to B, from B to C, and from A to C. For four computers, we'd need six cables. For 100 computers, we'd need 4,950 cables.<br>- This is a failure of scale. Connecting every machine to every other machine directly is physically impossible.<br>- The logical solution is to have a central device. Every computer connects to this one central point (let's call it a Switch). When Computer A wants to talk to Computer C, it sends the message to the switch, and the switch forwards it only to Computer C.<br>- We have just invented a Local Network. A group of computers in close proximity (like an office or a home) can now communicate efficiently.</p>

       <h2>Summary from First Principles.</h2>
       <p>So, the internet isn't magic. It's a series of logical solutions to a series of fundamental problems:
        <ol>
          <li><b>Problem: </b>Share data between two computers. <b>Solution:</b> A direct physical link.</li>
          <li><b>Problem: </b>Connect many computers efficiently. <b>Solution:</b> A local network with a central switch.</li>
          <li><b>Problem: </b>Connect many networks efficiently. <b>Solution:</b> An internetwork connected by routers.</li>
          <li><b>Problem: </b>Find a specific computer in this massive web. <b>Solution:</b> A universal IP Address for every device.</li>
          <li><b>Problem: </b>Send data reliably and fairly without errors. <b>Solution:</b> A set of rules (TCP/IP) to break data into small, addressed packets that can be reassembled.</li>
        </ol>
       </p>

    <div>
      <h2>IP Address</h2>
      <p><b>An IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)</b> address is the classic IP address format everyone is used to seeing.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Structure: </b>It's a 32-bit number. To make it readable for humans, we divide it into four 8-bit sections, and write each section as a decimal number from 0 to 255.
          <ul>
            <li>Example: 172.217.16.142 (one of Google's addresses)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>The Big Problem (The Why): </b>A 32-bit number means there's a hard limit on the total number of possible addresses: 2^32, which is about 4.3 billion.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>When the internet was designed, 4.3 billion seemed like an infinite number. But with the explosion of laptops, phones, servers, smart watches, and even smart refrigerators, we quickly realized we would run out. This scarcity is the single most important reason we have public and private IPs.</p>

      <h2>Port Number</h2>
      <p>Port numbers are numerical identifiers (0-65535) in computer networking that identify specific applications or services on a device. They work with IP addresses to direct network traffic to the correct service on a machine, with common ports assigned to standard applications like HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443).<br>A port number is a <b>16-bit unsigned integer.</b>
      <ul>Let's break that down:
        <li><b>16-bit: </b>This means the number is stored using 16 binary digits (1s and 0s).</li>
        <li><b>Unsigned: </b>This means it cannot be negative. The values are all positive.</li>
      </ul>Because it's a 16-bit number, the total number of possible ports is 2^16, which equals 65,536.</p>

      <h2>DNS(DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM)</h2>
      <P>DNS is the global, distributed system that translates the human-friendly domain names into the computer-friendly IP addresses. Without it, you'd have to memorize hundreds of IP addresses to browse the web.
        <ol>Step-Wise:
          <li>Checking the Local Cache (Do I already know this?)</li>
          <li>The Recursive Resolver (Asking for Help)</li>
          <li>The Hierarchical Search (The Global Phonebook)</li>
          <li>The Journey Back</li>
          <li>The Final Connection</li>

        </ol>
